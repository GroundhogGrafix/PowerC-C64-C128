Function:
-------- 
char* binstr( unsigned num )

Purpose:
Convert a number that may be of type
unsigned to a printable binary 
string. Example unsigned $f0 to string 
"11110000".

Example usage:
printf("Number $f in binary is %s.", binstr( 0xf ));

Output:
Number $f in binary is 00001111.

Info: The string returned is stored
statically in the function. Another call
to binstr() will make the string
change. If you want to keep the string
you should duplicate it.

Purpose:
Convert a binary number in a string to 
an unsigned.

Example:
printf("1111 bin to dec is %x.", strbin("1111"));

Info: This function expects a NULL
terminated string.
